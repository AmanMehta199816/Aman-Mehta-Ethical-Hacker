## Virus Code - @echo
The `@echo` command is a basic command used in command-line interfaces, including Windows Command Prompt and Unix/Linux terminals. It is used to display text or variables on the console.

In ethical hacking, the `@echo` command can be used within scripts or batch files to display information, debug code, or automate tasks related to security testing or system administration. For example, it can be used to echo messages indicating the progress of a script, display the results of a network scan, or output the status of a security assessment tool.


![o0vwzuFwCGAFO](https://github.com/AmanMehta199816/Aman-Mehta-Ethical-Hacker/assets/96304523/ab9276c6-e881-4734-b592-07d49834a7be)
Here's a simple example of how the `@echo` command can be used in a batch file:

```batch
@echo off
echo Welcome to the Ethical Hacking Tool Suite
echo.
echo Initiating network scan...
nmap -sS target_ip
echo Network scan complete.
```

In this example, `@echo off` is used to suppress displaying commands on the console, while `echo` statements are used to display messages to the user before and after running the network scan using Nmap.
